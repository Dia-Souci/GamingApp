## üí≥ Payment Flow

1. **Cart Management**: Users add games to cart (stored in localStorage with session ID)
2. **Checkout**: User fills order form and proceeds to payment
3. **Payment Initiation**: Order is created and payment is initiated via Chargily
4. **Payment Processing**: User is redirected to Chargily payment page
5. **Success/Failure**: User is redirected back to success or failure page
6. **Order Completion**: Order is updated with payment status

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

### Session Management
- Cart sessions are managed with unique session IDs
- Sessions persist across browser sessions
- Session ID is used for order creation and payment processing

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling for API calls
- User-friendly error messages
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests

### Loading States
- Loading skeletons for better UX
- Proper loading states for all async operations
- Error states with retry options

### Payment Integration
- Seamless integration with Chargily payment gateway
- Support for multiple payment methods
- Proper success/failure handling
- Order status tracking

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd userFront
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Environment**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the API base URL to match your backend

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Ensure Backend is Running**:
   - Make sure the backend API is running on `http://localhost:3000`
   - Verify all endpoints are accessible

## üîç Testing the Integration

1. **Browse Games**: Visit the homepage to see games loaded from the API
2. **Add to Cart**: Add games to cart and verify session management
3. **Checkout Process**: Go through the complete checkout flow
4. **Payment Testing**: Test payment with Chargily test credentials
5. **Order Tracking**: Verify order creation and status updates

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Errors**:
   - Verify backend is running on correct port
   - Check CORS configuration in backend
   - Ensure API base URL is correct

2. **Payment Issues**:
   - Verify Chargily API key is correct
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Ensure success/failure URLs are accessible

3. **Cart Issues**:
   - Clear localStorage if cart gets corrupted
   - Check session ID generation
   - Verify cart persistence

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode by setting:
```env
VITE_ENVIRONMENT=development
```

This will log all API requests and responses to the console.

## üìù Notes

- The integration removes all mock data dependencies
- All API calls are now real and require a running backend
- Payment processing requires valid Chargily credentials
- Session management ensures cart persistence across browser sessions
- Error handling provides fallbacks for network issues

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- User authentication and account management
- Order history and tracking
- Email notifications
- Advanced filtering and search
