# 🚨 Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue: API Connection Error

The user frontend is showing errors because it cannot connect to the backend API. Here's how to fix it:

### **🔧 Quick Fix Steps:**

1. **Start the Backend API:**
   ```bash
   cd gaming-api
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. **Make sure MongoDB is running:**
   - If you have MongoDB installed locally, start it
   - Or use MongoDB Atlas (cloud version)

3. **Check the API URL:**
   - The frontend is trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000/api`
   - Make sure your API is running on port 3000

4. **Seed the database with games:**
   ```bash
   cd gaming-api
   node seed-games.js
   ```

### **🔍 What I Fixed:**

1. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for when the API is not available
2. **Undefined Checks**: Added checks for undefined responses to prevent crashes
3. **User-Friendly Messages**: Better error messages that tell you what's wrong

### **📋 Current Status:**

✅ **Frontend**: Fixed and ready  
✅ **Error Handling**: Improved  
❌ **Backend**: Needs to be started  
❌ **Database**: Needs to be seeded  

### **🎯 Next Steps:**

1. **Start the backend API** (most important!)
2. **Seed the database** with the games I created
3. **Test the frontend** - it should now work properly

### **🐛 Error Messages You'll See:**

- **"Unable to connect to the server"** = API is not running
- **"No games found"** = Database is empty (run the seed script)
- **"Network error"** = Check your internet connection

### **🚀 Once Everything is Running:**

- **User Frontend**: `http://localhost:3001` (or whatever port Vite uses)
- **Admin Dashboard**: `http://localhost:3002` (or whatever port you set)
- **API Backend**: `http://localhost:3000`

### **💡 Pro Tips:**

- Always start the backend first
- Check the console for detailed error messages
- The frontend will show helpful error messages now
- Use the browser's developer tools to see network requests
